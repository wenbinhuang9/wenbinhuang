# Just Finished All CSAPP Labs and Congratulations   

Today, eventually, I have finished all CSAPP labs. CSAPP labs are all very wonderful and most of them are very challenging. And I am super excited that I have finished all labs by myself, and I also learn much , much, much from this course. Thank you for Bryant, David R. O'Hallaron and CMU providing such an awesome course! 

My favorite lab is `Architecture Lab`. I have ever want to implement things like CPU and Processors, but I don't know how and where to start it. And arch lab gives me such an wonderful opportunity to explore the journey of how to implement a processor from ground up, such as how to build complex combinational circuit from simple logic gates, how to use HDL to express combinational circuit and also also we can design a processor from a software level. Further, it also teaches me how to design a ISA and encode for a ISA, and also how to design a sequential processor to a pipeline processor to improve performance. 

The most interesting lab is `bomb lab` and  `buffer lab`. When I worked on bomb lab, I can feel my heart bombed anytime. This lab teaches much for me, it teaches me the conventional use of registers, like %rdi, %rsi usually used as first and second params, and %rax usually used as return value, push and pop used as register context save and restore. Further, I also learn much conventional stack of function call, the params and return address are all put onto stack before calling subroutine. And I also use tools like `objdump, gdb` to reverse the binary code and also how to debug using gdb. All in all, too many things learn from bomb lab. 

`Buffer lab` is also super interesting. It teaches how to exploit buffer overflow to inject the code by changing the return address to the injected code. The most challenging part is the return-oriented programming , that is inject the malicious code using existing code, what a wondeful idea. 

`Cache lab` teaches me how to program high peformance code by understanding cache. 

`Malloc lab` is the most challenging one, because we have to deal with bunches of pointer arithmetic operations, which is error prone of `segmentation fault`. And this lab teaches much about different allocation strategies and data structure from implicit freelist, explicit free list to segregated free list and even buddy system. 

`Shell lab` gives the opportunity to understand one powerful IPC techniques provided by unix APIs, signal.  Through this lab, I got to know what is the fundamental techniques behind  commands like `ctrl x`, `ctrl z` , all of which are control by signals. 

Through `Proxy lab` , I dive into the http protocol, and learn how to parse a request from client, transfer to a http server and finally response back to client. 

Awesome course and awesome lab!
