## Watching video: Leslie Lamport - The Paxos Algorithm 

This is the video link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw3gsBms-f8. 

This vedios talks about how Leslie Lamport formalize the Paxos Algorithm.

But I also learned much from some of his words. For example, he told that the school does not teach how to use the math outside the mathematics. I learned much of mathematcis from element school, middle school, high school and to university. However, I don't know how to apply it. 

The video starts with consensus problem, and describe a consensus  system with natural language. And then Lamport formalizes the consensus system, or we can call it the definition of consensus system. 

The focus of the video is to how to formalize the Spec. Spec defines what is a consensus system, what are the contraints and properties and also a proof that how it can satisfy the quorums. Once we have such a general definition. We can use it to guide the implementation of algorithm. Because Spec does not define how to do that. But it provides a way to verify if a consensus algorithm is correct. 

So the purpose of formalization is that it provides a way to prove that if a consensus algorithm is correct.
