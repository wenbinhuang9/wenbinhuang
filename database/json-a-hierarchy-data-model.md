# Json a hierarchy data model 

Javascript creates the json, which is a very famous data model. Json is the awesome part of javascript. 

Compared with data model like csv, or row in relational database, it is more expressive, because it supports hierarchy structure. While the row data model does not able to support hierarchy strucutre, which makes it less expressive. For example, json is very expressive and flexible to store the profile data. 

Another important property in json is that it supports abundant data type, for example, it supports data structure like list, dictionary etc. 

Compared with XML, the json is more compact, which can help to save the bandwidth and also I/O or computation from performance perspective. But XML is more readable than json. As for simplicity, json is simpler than XML. 

Json plays a key role in API definition, in web service, many API definition request and response format is a json format.

The idea of document database also comes from json,  document database is expressive because it also supports hierarchy data model. 

Json is so popular that the relational database like mysql also support json data type.
